# EZ Biosystems Website Enhancement Recommendations

## Goals
### Core Competency Strengthening Goals

The core competencies of EZ Biosystems website are its product catalog and ordering process, that would allow customers to 

1. find the company's products through general search engine
2. determine whether the products meet their needs
3. order products as confidently and conveniently as possible   

Competency strengthening should include the following aspects:

1. Make it easier for potential and existing customers, through general search and otherwise, to become aware or stay informed of the company's products and their competitiveness.

2. Make product catalog contents easier to navigate and comprehend, while with a presentation considered appropriate by relevant audience (R & D professionals), to help customers expedite confident decision making.

3. Make ordering more convenient and flexible (assuming it's already sufficiently reliable), but without creating perceptions of over-marketing/sales.   

### General User Experience Enhancement Goals

1. Mobile friendly
2. Adopt best design practices that are relevant 
3. Add alternative user flows without breaking the ones are proven to be working  
4. Richer and better media components 
5. Remove/Replace obsolete user experience components
6. ....

## Recommending an Incremental Approach

Comparing to a complete overhaul, an incremental approach could be a good balance of core competency strengthening, general user experience enhancement, resource allocation, as well as vision re-creation.
  
To support a later decision to move out of out-dated ASP platform, re-design documentation should be made so that such change from enhanced pages is relatively easy.
 
### Considerations/Justifications

1. Infrastructure
2. Platform (language/framework base of the software)
3. Security
4. Project time span (how long it takes to see at least some enhancements)

## Priorities

1. Secure links
2. Product listing page prototype
3. Per product page prototype
4. Home page and header/navigation prototype
5. Other pages
 
### Secure Links

Pages with HTTP URLs are ranked lower than those with HTTPS URLs. 

#### DO THIS IMMEDIATELY 

Do this immediately without having to waiting for any other change:

1.  If possible, change web server configuration to force all such redirect.
2.  Go through all pages to find all HTTP URLs and replace with their counterpart HTTPS URLs, and test to make sure the secure links work.

### Product Listing Page 

Live prototype -- in progress.  

### Per Product Page

Live prototype -- in progress.  

### Home Page and Header/Navigation

Live prototype -- in progress.  Expected to be limited to:

1. responsive header and top nav menu (top level) 
2. enhanced/adjusted header layout and color 
3. enhanced/re-formatted logo

## More General Recommendations 

A few other general recommendations (not an exhaustive list):

1. eliminate multi-level menu navigation, and focus on enhancement of page
2. combine top level and second level product pages (and similarly simplify other sections) 
3. consider a testimonial section on home page
4. less keywords in HTML header of home page
